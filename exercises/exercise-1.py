# Create a simple calulator
# that receives two numbers a and b from the terminal
# and shows the `summation`, `substraction`, `multiplication` and `division`
# of that two number

# hint: `input` function receives a text from terminal.
# note: we will learn about `int()` later.

# Complete this code:

a = int(input("Enter a: "))
b = int(input("Enter b: "))

sum = a + b
